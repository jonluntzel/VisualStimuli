# VisualStimuli
A tool for creating large datasets with dimensions of interest such as angle of rotation, noise, stimulus size, and degree of shifting in eight directions (U, D, L, R, diagonals). Gives users flexibility to both make datasets and assess various classifiers (LDA, SVM, RFC for example) on them.
